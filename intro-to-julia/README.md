# Intro to Julia 

These notebooks are the solutions for the intro to Julia found at [juliabox](https://juliabox.com/). 

All the rights go to the JuliaComputing team and their contributors for making such succint material available, it was definetely a kickstarter for myself.

I don't know if I'll finish the folder, as I'm not really interested in solving math problems at the moment, but I'll keep it as an open issue for later date.
